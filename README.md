# LostIt
An app that comes handy when we misplace our phones and it works with the use of SMS, hence no Internet connection is rquired!!
Currently it has three features:

1.Retreive Contacts: Have you been in situations when you don't have your phone with you and need to call someone . Now it's no more an issue just use someone else's phone to send an sms
to your phone along with the contact name and in return the sender phone will receive an SMS containing the contact number of the provided name.

2.Ring the phone: Using this feature we can make our phone ring(even if it is in silent mode) in max volume for a certain peroid of time. This comes handy in situations where we
misplace our phones and search for it.

3.Display user info: Using this feature we can display a user specified name and number as a sticky notification in user's phone. So that if someone finds that phone he/she can
contact it's user.
